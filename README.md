One of the first things I do to warm-up my brain and constantly introduce myself to new challenges is solving a challenge on Codewars! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor my code in order to optimize its efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The most important lesson I learn by combating the near-endless challenges in Codewars is that there is always something to learn. Not knowing how to complete every challenge is okay, as long as you then take the time to learn how to complete the challenges placed in front of you.
